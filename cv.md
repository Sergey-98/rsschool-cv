## About me

My name is Sergey Yatsenko.

I am 23 years old. I am a graduate of the Saratov State Technical University. During my studies, I was engaged in programming robotic platforms, participated in competitions. Now I work as a design engineer. I sure that my work does not give me development, so I want to learn to program. By doing programming, I can constantly develop, improve my strengths and weaknesses. I like web development because I can write something and see the result right away. That’s why I’m here.

* My strengths:
    + Purposefulness
    + Stress resistance
    + Desire to learn all my life
    + Punctuality
